# IAN - Iterative Adaptive Neighborhoods

IAN is an algorithm for estimating a data graph from data points or pairwise distances. It can be used in manifold applications, such as dimensionality reduction, geodesic inference, and local dimensionality estimation. For more information, please refer to the paper:

Dyballa, L., Zucker, S. W. (2022), "IAN: Iterative Adaptive Neighborhoods for manifold learning and dimensionality estimation", _Neural Computation_, 35 (in press). Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09123

## Installation

From the command line run:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/dyballa/IAN
```

You will need to have `git` installed for this command to work. I plan to create a pip-installable package soon.

## Documentation

I am currently adding docs for all available functions. You will also find short demos in the notebooks available in the [`examples`](/examples) folder. Feel free to contact me by email if you have any questions.
